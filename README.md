# 🎮 Simon Says Game

A web-based memory game inspired by the classic **Simon Says**! The game flashes colored buttons in a sequence, and the player must repeat the sequence correctly to level up.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game starts when the user presses any key.
- A random color button will flash.
- The user must click the button that flashed.
- With each level, a new color is added to the sequence.
- If the user clicks the wrong button, the game ends and displays **"Game Over"**.

- CSS animations for button flashes.

- Simple and responsive layout.
